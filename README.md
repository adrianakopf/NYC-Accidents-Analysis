## OBJECTIVE
Better understand safety issues, factors that contribute to accidents, and model such a relationship.

## SAFETY TRENDS
Are New York City pedestrians and cyclists safer today then they were in 2013?

## CONTRIBUTING ACCIDENT FACTORS
How do electronics, cell phones, and drugs have been affecting the accidents over the years?

## BOROUGHS
What were the major causes of accidents?
When did accidents occur?
Where specifically does accidents happen?

## MACHINE LEARNING
How to model the crash data and build a model that predict the type of collision based on information collected from accident reports?

## CONCLUSIONS
* Safety of pedestrians and cyclists have been improving in 2013 - 2019. 
* The trend of cyclist injuries has improved significantly.
* When considering all accidents that have caused deaths, the top 3 contributing factors are: failure to yield right-of-way, driver distraction and traffic control disregard.
* When comparing the contribution of general electronics and cell phones to injuries and deaths; general electronics caused over 100 injuries between 2013 and 2015. Since 2016 the number of injuries caused by electronics  have been declining, Cell phone injuries have slowly increased since 2015.
* Comparing alcohol, illegal drugs, and prescription medications in accidents involving the motorist; alcohol has caused most injuries over the years.  On the other hand, prescription medications injuries have decreased significantly since 2016.
* Highly dense areas and darkness results in the highest injuries and deaths.
* The machine learning methodology confirms the results that person-related variables are the top contributing factors in accidents. 
* Person-, Road-, Weather-, and Vehicle-related variables relatively contribute 80%, 8%, 7%, and 4%, respectively, to the traffic crashes.
